Loading this 'private.xml' into Karabiner for Mac OS (https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) will allow you to remap underscore to either shift-space or control-space.

Steps:

1. Add xml code to private.xml file:
  1. If you did not previously create a Karabiner 'private.xml', just copy this one into your '/Users/your_name/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/' folder.

  2. If you have already created a Karabiner 'private.xml', you probably know how this works -- just copy the xml items into your own 'private.xml'-file in your '/Users/your_name/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/' folder.

2. Open Karabiner (tested in version 10.2.0), go to the Change Key tab and push ReloadXML.

3. One of the items in the list should now be "Swap Underscore to Modified Space". Select your underscore replacement of choice and voila: easy underscore typing.
